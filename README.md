# Find My Booze App

This application deals with searching LCBO stores in the users proximity to see if the alcohol the user wants to purchase is in stock.

This is done in the following steps:

1. The user searches for their alcohol
2. The user selects the alcohol that they want to purchase
3. The using user's geolocation, the closest 20 stores that are in stock are displayed.

# Next Steps

This application is a MVP. Future upgrades to this application would include pagination, linting, test cases, google maps api, and in-depth store information.

# The Code Base

This application was developed using AngularJS 1.6, NodeJS 11.2, and Express 4.16.4.

This was the first time I used Express. I thought that I would take this opportunity to learn a new framework.

# Starting the app

Install nodeJS and then go to the folder directory in your terminal and type,
`make install`.

# Starting the server

To start the server, go to the folder directory in your terminal and type,
`make serve`.
